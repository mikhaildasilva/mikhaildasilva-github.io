### Glossary

[Shore hardness](https://www.smooth-on.com/page/durometer-shore-hardness-scale/) scales provides a point of reference when measuring the ***hardness*** of materials. 

### Why use Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) instead of Silicone?

"Typical" soft robots utilise [Silicone](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/ecoflex-00-30/) of eclectic shore hardness' to impart compliance. However, Silicone takes a considerable amount of time (4 - 12 hrs) to cure. Additionally, 

- Silicone takes a considerable amount of time to cure ([4](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/ecoflex-00-30/) - [16](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/dragon-skin-30/) hours). 
- Necessity of additional expensive equipment
    - Vacuum chamber and pump to remove air bubbles.
    - Inverse moulds of the end product are required to pour Silicone in them.
    - Weighing scales, gloves, eye protection gear, an apron and non-lather soap are necessary.
