### Glossary

[Shore hardness](https://www.smooth-on.com/page/durometer-shore-hardness-scale/) scales provides a point of reference when measuring the ***hardness*** of materials.

### Why use Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) instead of Silicone?

"Typical" soft robots utilise [Silicone](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/ecoflex-00-30/) of eclectic shore Hardness' to impart compliance. 

#### A few challenges that arise when using Silicone:

- Silicone takes a considerable amount of time to cure ([4](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/ecoflex-00-30/) hours - [16](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/dragon-skin-30/) hours). 
- Necessity of additional expensive equipment
    - Vacuum chamber and pump to remove air bubbles.
    - Inverse moulds of the end product are required to pour Silicone in them.
    - Weighing scales, gloves, eye protection gear, an apron and non-lather soap are necessary. 
- Accurate mixing ratio of Part A and Part B followed by slow stirring of the liquid rubber.
- A release agent spray for "easy" removal of part from mould.
